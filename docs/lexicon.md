# Glossary

Allows you to specify terms and their respective definitions to be displayed as annotations. Based on those terms, GitBook will automatically build an index and highlight those terms in pages.

The `GLOSSARY.md` format is very simple :

```markdown
# Term
Definition for this term

# Another term
With it's definition, this can contain bold text
and all other kinds of inline markup ...
```
